A research on customer segmentation based on mall customers survey

In this analysis, I used this [mall_customers.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/shwetabh123/mall-customers?select=Mall_Customers.csv) file to understand the demographics of mall shoppers and group them into different characteristics. My goal is to help mall businesses grow their sales channels by segmenting customers and helping them target their desired consumers with appropriate advertising in the future. There were 200 consumers surveyed over 5 key characteristics which are: 
* id
* Gender
* Age
* Annual Income
* Spending Score
